# Web-Design-Visualization


### Background
Data is more powerful when we share it with others! This project uses HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis weather data
### Webpage
The webpage can be viewd here https://claude-hanfou.github.io/Web-Design-Visualization/


### Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
For this project we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations using weather data.

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
